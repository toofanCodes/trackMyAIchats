## üí° Why I Built This

As an avid user of large language models, I constantly found myself frustrated by the lack of easy navigation within chat interfaces. This extension is my personal solution to that persistent nuisance, and I'm open-sourcing it for fellow enthusiasts who might find it useful.

*   **Automatic Question Bookmarking:** Automatically detects and bookmarks your questions as you type them.
*   **Artifact Detection:** (e.g., code snippets, function names) within Gemini responses.
*   **Persistent Sidebar:** A draggable and resizable sidebar that stays with you across chat sessions.
*   **One-Click Navigation:** Click a bookmark to instantly scroll to that point in the conversation.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Supports ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.
