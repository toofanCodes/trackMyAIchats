## 💡 Why I Built This

As an avid user of large language models, I constantly found myself frustrated by the lack of easy navigation within chat interfaces. This extension is my personal, perhaps 'dumb,' solution to that surprisingly persistent nuisance: the endless scroll to find that one crucial question. I'm open-sourcing it for fellow enthusiasts who might find this simple fix useful.

*Disclaimer: This is "vibe-code" developed with the assistance of Cursor, and in some cases, Gemini CLI. Transparency is key!*

## 🛠️ Features

*   **Automatic Question Bookmarking:** Automatically detects and bookmarks your questions as you type them.

*   **Platform Support:** Supports ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.
*   **SPA Navigation:** Automatically refreshes when you navigate between chats.
