## üí° Why I Built This

As an avid user of large language models, I constantly found myself frustrated by the lack of easy navigation within chat interfaces. This extension is my personal, perhaps 'dumb,' solution to that surprisingly persistent nuisance: the endless scroll to find that one crucial question. I'm open-sourcing it for fellow enthusiasts who might find this simple fix useful.

*Disclaimer: This is "vibe-code" developed with the assistance of Cursor, and in some cases, Gemini CLI. Transparency is key!*
